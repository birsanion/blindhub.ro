                <p>
                    As of 25.05.2018, Regulation 2016/679 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, also known as the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), becomes applicable.

                    What is personal data?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. The various pieces of information that may lead to the identification of a particular person also constitute personal data. Personal data that has been anonymized, encrypted or pseudonymized but can be used to re-identify a person remains personal data and is covered by the GDPR (RGPD). Personal data that has been made anonymous in such a way that the individual is no longer or is no longer identifiable is no longer considered personal data. For data to be truly anonymized, anonymization must be irreversible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    RGPD protects personal data regardless of the technology used to process the data - it is "technology neutral" and applies to both automatic and manual processing, provided that the data is organized according to predefined criteria (e.g. , in alphabetical order). It also doesn't matter how the data is stored - in an ICT system, by video surveillance or on paper; In all these cases, personal data are subject to the protection requirements set out in the RGPD.

                    - collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not subsequently processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, for scientific or historical research or for statistical purposes is not considered incompatible with the original purposes, in accordance with Article 89 (1) of the GDPR ("purpose-related limitations");<br>
                    - appropriate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed ("data minimization");<br>

                    - kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for a period not exceeding the period necessary for the purposes for which the data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods to the extent that they are processed exclusively for archiving purposes in the public interest, for scientific or historical research or for statistical purposes, in accordance with Article 89 (1) of GDPR, subject to the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures provided for in the GDPR Regulation in order to guarantee the rights and freedoms of the data subject ("storage restrictions");<br>
